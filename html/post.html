        Jimi Hendrix was arguably the greatest instrumentalist in the history of
        rock music.[1] Hendrix expanded the range and vocabulary of the electric
        guitar into areas no musician had ever ventured before. His boundless
        drive, technical ability and creative application of such effects as
        distortion forever transformed the sound of rock and roll. While
        creating his unique musical voice and guitar style, Hendrix synthesized
        diverse genres, including blues, R&B, soul, British rock, American folk
        music, 1950s rock and roll, psychedelic and jazz. Hendrix favored
        overdriven amplifiers with high volume and gain.[119] He was
        instrumental in developing the previously undesirable technique of
        guitar amplifier feedback, and helped to popularize use of the wah-wah
        pedal in mainstream rock.[348] He rejected the standard barre chord
        fretting technique used by most guitarists in favor of fretting the low
        6th string root notes with his thumb.[349] He applied this technique
        during the beginning bars of "Little Wing", which allowed him to sustain
        the root note of chords while also playing melody. This method has been
        described as piano style, with the thumb playing what a pianist's left
        hand would play and the other fingers playing melody as a right
        hand.[350] Having spent several years fronting a trio, he developed an
        ability to play rhythm chords and lead lines together, giving the audio
        impression that more than one guitarist was performing.[351][nb 41] He
        was the first artist to incorporate stereophonic phasing effects in rock
        music recordings.[354] Holly George-Warren of Rolling Stone commented:
        "Hendrix pioneered the use of the instrument as an electronic sound
        source. Players before him had experimented with feedback and
        distortion, but Hendrix turned those effects and others into a
        controlled, fluid vocabulary every bit as personal as the blues with
        which he began."[3][nb 42] Aledort wrote: "In rock guitar, there are but
        two eras ï¿½ before Hendrix and after Hendrix."
